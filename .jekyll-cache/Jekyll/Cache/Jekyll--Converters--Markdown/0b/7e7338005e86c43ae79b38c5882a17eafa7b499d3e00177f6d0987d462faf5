<p><strong>Social Media Website</strong>  <span style="float: right; "></span><br />
<i> Developed a Social Media Website that allows users to create an account and post. The website is a fully functional website that furthered my knowledge in web development. This project helped understand the main elements of how most social media websites function. To create this website I used html, css, and client and server side javascript, and a database using postgres. Along with this I learned Source code management through git and github.</i></p>
